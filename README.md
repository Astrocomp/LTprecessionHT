# The Lense-Thirring precession in the Hartle-Thorne metric #

This Mathematica notebook is provided as supplementary material for the article by Török et al., submitted to Astronomy & Astrophysics (a link will be provided after submission). If you use this notebook or the corrections in your work, please cite the corresponding paper.

The notebook contains the complete components of the Hartle-Thorne metric, as described by [Hartle&Thorne 1968](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1968ApJ...153..807H/abstract), [Abramowicz et al 2003](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2003gr.qc....12070A/abstract) and [Urbancová et al. 2019](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019ApJ...877...66U/abstract))), as well as the Lense-Thirring metric.

Additionally, it includes terms corresponding to the contributions of frame-dragging and quadrupole effects to the azimuthal and radial orbital frequencies. Terms reflecting the effects of neutron star rotation are provided in their full form, along with expressions for the vertical epicyclic frequency.

The notebook reads the text file `LTcorrections.txt`, which contains pressure corrections related to the oscillations of fluid tori in the Lense-Thirring metric, based on the work of Matuszková et al. ([2024a](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2024A%26A...691A.167M/abstract), [2024b](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2024A%26A...691A.168M/abstract)). Due to file size constraints, the file `corrections.txt`, which includes the corrections for the full Hartle-Thorne metric, is available upon request. Both files have to be located in the same folder as the Mathematica Notebook.
