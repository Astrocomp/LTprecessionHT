# The Lense-Thirring precession in the Hartle-Thorne metric #

Additional Mathematica notebook provided to article Török et al., submitted to the Astronomy&Astrophysics (link to be provided after submission). This paper should be cited if the Notebook or the corrections are used in your work.

Notebook includes complete components of the Hartle-Thorne mectric ([Hartle&Thorne 1968](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1968ApJ...153..807H/abstract)[Abramowicz et al 2003](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2003gr.qc....12070A/abstract), [Urbancová et al. 2019](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019ApJ...877...66U/abstract)) and of the Lense-Thirring metric.

The notebook further provides terms associated with the the additional frame-dragging and quadrupole contributions to the azimuthal and the radial orbital frequencices. Terms reflecting the effects induced by the central neutron star rotation are provided in their complete form in this Wolfram Mathematica notebook, together with the terms in the vertical epicyclic frequency.

The Notebook reads the text file `LTcorrections.txt`, which includes the pressure corrections corresponding to oscilations of fluid tori to the frequencies in the Lense-Thirring metric, based on [Matuszková et al. 2024a](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2024A%26A...691A.167M/abstract) and [Matuszková et al. 2024b](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2024A%26A...691A.168M/abstract). File `corrections.txt`, which includes these corrections for the full Hartle-Thorne metric, is avaliable on request due to the fle size. Both of these files have to be located in the same folder as the Mathematica Notebook.
